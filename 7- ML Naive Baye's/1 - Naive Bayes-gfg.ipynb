    "### What is Naive Bayes Classifiers?\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes‚Äô Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other. "

    "This model predicts the probability of an instance belongs to a class with a given set of feature value. It is a probabilistic classifier. It is because it assumes that one feature in the model is independent of existence of another feature. In other words, each feature contributes to the predictions with no relation between each other. In real world, this condition satisfies rarely. It uses Bayes theorem in the algorithm for training and prediction\n",

    "#### Why it is Called Naive Bayes?\n",
    "The **‚ÄúNaive‚Äù** part of the name indicates the simplifying assumption made by the Na√Øve Bayes classifier. The classifier assumes that the features used to describe an observation are conditionally independent, given the class label. The ‚ÄúBayes‚Äù part of the name refers to Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician and theologian who formulated Bayes‚Äô theorem."

    "\n",
    "- **Feature independence:** The features of the data are conditionally independent of each other, given the class label.\n",
    "- **Continuous features are normally distributed:** If a feature is continuous, then it is assumed to be normally distributed within each class.\n",
    "- **Discrete features have multinomial distributions:** If a feature is discrete, then it is assumed to have a multinomial distribution within each class.\n",
    "- **Features are equally important:** All features are assumed to contribute equally to the prediction of the class label.\n",
    "- **No missing data:** The data should not contain any missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With relation to our dataset, this concept can be understood as:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We assume that no pair of features are dependent. For example, the temperature being ‚ÄòHot‚Äô has nothing to do with the humidity or the outlook being ‚ÄòRainy‚Äô has no effect on the winds. Hence, the features are assumed to be independent.\n",
    "- Secondly, each feature is given the same weight(or importance). For example, knowing only temperature and humidity alone can‚Äôt predict the outcome accurately. None of the attributes is irrelevant and assumed to be contributing equally to the outcome."
